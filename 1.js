ie.  1. HTML= Stands for hyper text markup language   (4 or 5 version)
     2. CSS = Cascading Style Sheets   (2,3) version
     3. JS = Java script (also know as vanilla js) version Es5(all browser support that) or Es6(Some brownser support that )

    Cake PHP
    Laravel PHP
    Symphony 

2. Ruby 
   Ruby on rails 
   
3. Python

4. Js 
   Nodejs

     //Question based upon that -
     Q-1 Why we used html,css and js in web dev??
     Ans Beacuse html and css are backbone of web dev (through that we can design basic webpage)
     if we want to make a webpage dynamic ,then we use js. Without that webpage look like very ugly.

Q-2 In this why we use js i.e nodejs in backend??
Ans Nodejs is generally a javascript run time environment that we used in backend (at server)
    Nodejs is fast 
    Its easy for programmer to learn only one language (server side as well as client side )
    That's why we are using nodejs as backend language in this training


    There different of library of js through that our life become very easy
    1. React
    2. Vue
    3. Angular

    

    Q-1 How website work??

    Ans let suppose we search a website google.com after that request send to server (that present anywhere in world)
    The server will serve us html, css (client side )
    Js =Let suppose we click a button it will show a alert (this we will do it with js )

    backend =Suppose when you enter detail in a form ,and submit it. It will store in database  (we do it with nodejs )
